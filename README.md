# Predicting Real Estate Prices with RandomForest

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on various features using the RandomForest algorithm. It is designed to be executed in a local environment after cloning from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone [URL of the GitHub repository]
   cd [repository name]
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Note: The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your project depends on, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and any others you use.

## Running the Project

To run the project on your local machine:

1. **Open the notebook:**
   - If you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed, you can open the project notebook (`Final_ML_Project.ipynb`) by running:
     ```
     jupyter notebook Final_ML_Project.ipynb
     ```
     or
     ```
     jupyter lab Final_ML_Project.ipynb
     ```

   - Alternatively, if you prefer using Visual Studio Code or another IDE that supports `.ipynb` files, open the project file directly in your IDE.

2. **Run the notebook cells:** Start from the top and execute each cell sequentially to ensure all variables and functions are correctly initialized. Pay attention to any cell that requires specific inputs or adjustments based on your environment.

## Project Structure

- `Final_ML_Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the project code, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: This directory should contain the dataset used in the project. (Note: You might need to adjust this based on how you manage data within your project.)
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved. (This might need to be created manually or by the notebook.)
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the dependencies required to run the project.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
